## Supply Chain

### Introduction
#### Supply Chain Analysis: A Brief Overview

* Supply chain analysis is the systematic process of examining the flow of goods and services from raw materials to the end consumer.
*  It aims to identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement within a company's supply chain.

**Key Objectives:**

* *Cost Reduction:* Minimize expenses related to procurement, production, and distribution.
* *Efficiency Enhancement:* Streamline processes to improve speed and responsiveness.
* *Risk Mitigation:* Identify and address potential disruptions.
* *Customer Value Improvement:* Enhance delivery reliability and service quality.
* *Inventory Optimization:* Balance inventory levels to meet demand while minimizing holding costs.

**Common Analysis Techniques:**
* *Data Analysis:* Using metrics like lead times, inventory turnover, and defect rates.
* *Process Mapping:* Visually representing the supply chain to identify inefficiencies.
* *Demand Forecasting:* Predicting future demand to optimize production and inventory.
* *Supplier Evaluation:* Assessing supplier performance based on quality, reliability, and cost.
* *Risk Assessment:* Identifying and evaluating potential supply chain disruptions.

**Why it's Important:**

* Effective supply chain analysis enables businesses to optimize operations, improve customer satisfaction, and gain a competitive advantage.

E.D.A 
```sql
SELECT * FROM supply_chain
```
```sql
SELECT 
      DISTINCT product_type 
FROM supply_chain
```

```sql
SELECT 
      DISTINCT product_type,
      sku,
      stock_levels
FROM supply_chain;
```

```sql
SELECT 
     customer_demographics,
     ROUND(SUM(revenue_generated)::integer,2) AS rev_per_demographic
FROM supply_chain
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2
```

```sql
SELECT
      product_type,
     SUM(manufacturing_costs) AS total_man_cost,
     AVG(manufacturing_lead_time) AS avg_lead_time
FROM supply_chain
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC, 3 DESC
```

ANALYSIS 
1. Revenue generated by product type
```sql
SELECT
      product_type,
      ROUND(SUM(revenue_generated)::integer,2) AS rev_per_product
FROM supply_chain
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC 
```

2. Understanding sku and stock level 
```sql
SELECT 
      sku,
      SUM(order_quantities) AS total_orders,
      SUM(stock_levels) AS total_stock,
      CASE
          WHEN SUM(stock_levels) < SUM(order_quantities) THEN 'out_of_stock'
          WHEN SUM(stock_levels) > SUM(order_quantities) THEN 'available'
          END AS stock_available
FROM supply_chain
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC , 3 DESC
```

3. Importance of customer demographics in the chain 
```sql
SELECT
      customer_demographics,
      ROUND(SUM(revenue_generated)::integer,2) AS revenue_per_demographic,
      AVG(lead_times) AS avg_lead_time
FROM supply_chain   
WHERE customer_demographics != 'Unknown' 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC, 3 DESC    
```

4. Understanding shipping times, shipping carriers and shipping costs
```sql
SELECT
      shipping_carriers,
      ROUND(AVG(shipping_times)) AS avg_shipping_times,
      ROUND(SUM(shipping_costs)) AS total_costs
FROM supply_chain
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 ASC, 3 DESC 
```

5. Knowing the product type cost of making
```sql
SELECT
      product_type,
      ROUND(AVG(manufacturing_lead_time),2) AS avg_manufact_lead_times,
      ROUND(SUM(manufacturing_costs)::integer,2) AS total_manufact_cost
FROM supply_chain
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 ASC, 3 DESC
```

6. Analyzing products and their inspection results
```sql
WITH inspection 
AS
(
SELECT
    product_type,
    inspection_results,
    COUNT(*) AS count_results
FROM supply_chain
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC 
) 
SELECT
      product_type,
      SUM(count_results) AS total_fails
FROM inspection
WHERE inspection_results = 'Fail'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

7. Analyzing products by defect rates
```sql
WITH defect
AS
(
SELECT
     product_type,
     defect_rates,
     AVG(defect_rates) AS avg_defect 
FROM supply_chain
GROUP BY 1 , 2
)
SELECT
     product_type,
     AVG(avg_defect) AS avg_per_product
FROM defect
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

8. Analyzing transportation modes and routes with their costs
```sql
SELECT
      transportation_modes,
      ROUND(SUM(costs)::integer,2) AS cost_per_mode
FROM supply_chain
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

```sql
SELECT
      routes,
      ROUND(SUM(costs)::integer,2) AS cost_per_mode
FROM supply_chain
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
```

9. Analyzing the Supply Chain by looking at the relationship between the price of the products and
 the revenue generated by them
```sql
SELECT
     product_type,
     CORR(price, revenue_generated) AS correlation
FROM supply_chain
GROUP BY 1
```

   - Certain demographics have higher average lead times.

4. **Shipping Times, Carriers, and Costs**:
   - There are variations in average shipping times and total shipping costs across different carriers.
   - Some carriers are more cost-effective than others.

5. **Manufacturing Costs and Lead Times**:
   - Manufacturing costs and lead times vary across product types.
   - Some product types have higher manufacturing costs and longer lead times.

6. **Inspection Results**:
   - Certain product types have higher failure rates in inspections.
   - The total number of inspection failures varies by product type.

7. **Defect Rates**:
